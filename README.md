### A Reaction Paper on "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (1950) by Alan M. Turing

Alan M. Turing’s paper entitled “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” is an exceptional paper that explores the hypothetical idea of having machines capable of exhibiting human intelligence, as first inquired through the first section of the paper with the question “Can machines think?” This question, which asks whether machines are capable of exhibiting human intelligence to simulate human thought, is the central idea being discussed in the paper. Through the paper, Turing argues that indeed, a machine can be capable of thinking and that this is only possible in the later future where the limitations of a machine at the time are surpassed and aren’t constrained with its functionalities to be able to accomplish such a remarkable feat. With such a remarkable paper published in the 1950s, one can only praise Turing for his inquisitive idea on this hypothetical thought, and it is through this reaction paper that I wish to highlight important points discussed throughout the sections of the paper that I deem as remarkable in presenting supportive arguments about the idea of having machines possess the capacity to think. 

The first few sections of the paper expound on the central question explored throughout the paper, which is the question: “Can machines think?” Turing points out with his discussions about the semantics of the question, with what a machine is, what characteristics it possesses, and what kind of machine qualifies one to be a subject of this question. Turing clears the ambiguity of the subject discussed by specifying how they refer to digital computers which can be classified as a discrete state machine, consisting of finite states. Turing also discusses how digital computers have the special property to mimic the discrete state machine of any computer, and he describes every digital computer as having the capacity to be a "universal machine." The universal machine is a key idea that supports Turing with the idea of having a machine that can partake in the Imitation Game, which is a hypothetical game he proposed in the first section of the paper, which tests whether a machine can be said to have the capacity to think, as its behavior is indistinguishable from human intelligence. Due to the "universality" of digital machines, they can therefore mimic the behavior of a human being, offering a key insight into how a machine can pass the Turing test and be perceived as capable of human intelligence. Turing also discusses in the latter sections of the paper about the different conflicting views opposing the question he has about machines having the capacity to exhibit human intelligence. He covered numerous objections, such as "The Theological Objection," "Arguments from Various Disabilities," "Lady Lovelace's Objection," and "The Argument from Informality of Behavior," just to name a few. It is important to note how remarkable it is for Turing to address different aspects of the question, which suggests he has a profound understanding of different dimensions of the idea. This extensive understanding of the question explains how he can construct what I would call a resounding resolution to the question, through his idea of "learning machines", which he discusses in the final section of the paper. He explores the idea that, instead of constructing a digital machine designed to mimic human behavior to exhibit intelligence, one should build a machine that can learn from its environment and, with sufficient guidance, determine the most desirable action to take in any situation it encounters. This remarkable idea is the foundation of what we now recognize as artificial intelligence, revolutionizing how we think about machines and learning. Turing’s vision has undoubtedly advanced technology and has contributed to the foundation of what we know today as artificial intelligence.

  Upon reading Turing's paper, it is clear that his proposal was revolutionary, especially for the 1950s. His insights laid the groundwork for artificial intelligence, challenging how we think about machine intelligence and its potential. While Turing’s vision has undoubtedly advanced technology, it also opens the door to new ethical and philosophical questions that we continue to grapple with today. However, it is essential to recognize that Turing's framework does not encompass the full scope of human intelligence, as seen in the concept of the total Turing Test, which examines not only linguistic behavior but also emotional and social understanding. This indicates that while Turing's ideas were foundational, we must continue to expand and refine our definitions of machine intelligence to reflect the complexities of human thought and interaction in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.
